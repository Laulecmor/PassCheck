# Password Generator Starter Code
# PassCheck

This was a project so users could generate a new password - with the option to include chracters like numbers, uppercase letters, lower case letters, and special chracters. 

In the script.js I created arrays for the characters that could be included in the password then after making some declarations I wrote a function so that once hitting "generate password" on the page, you will be prompted to decide all of the customization availible for a password. 

I didn't have to touch the CSS or the HTML page.
